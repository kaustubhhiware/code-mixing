This repository contains all the codes pertaining to "Code mixing patterns in Celebrities" / "Quantifying Sense Deviation in Twitter". **(Project 16)** by students of **group 6** as a part of Speech & Natural Language Processing course (CS60057), Autumn 2017.

## Task distribution

Our work was largely classified into 3 tasks:

### Task 1: Tagging and Formatting
For every tweet in our dataset, we classify each word and assign a word-level tag and phrase(matrix)-level tag.
Apart from this, each tweet is tagged as En / Hi / Code-switched / Code-mix-En / Code-mix-Hi / Code-mix-Equal / Other.
This will be used later. Please refer to [Task_1_Formatting](Task_1_Formatting) for further details.

### Task 2: Dataset Analysis
Using the paper [All that is English may be Hindi: Enhancing language identification through automatic ranking of likeliness of word borrowing in social media](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08446), we shall be computing UUR values, UTR and UPR values.
To check the efficiency of our tagging, we shall use Jaccard coefficient and Spearmann coefficients as evalution measures.
Refer to [Task_2_DatasetAnalysis](Task_2_DatasetAnalysis) for further details.

### Task 3: Sense Deviation
Referring to the techniques used in [Hamiltonâ€™s (2016): Diachronic Word Embeddings Reveal Statistical Laws of Semantic Change](https://aclanthology.info/pdf/P/P16/P16-1141.pdf) and [Analyzing Semantic Changes in Japanese Loanwords](https://aclanthology.info/pdf/E/E17/E17-1112.pdf) to understand what senses an English word when used in Hindi context is used in context of social media.
Further details are mentioned in [Task_3_SenseDeviation](Task_3_SenseDeviation).

The results for each part are mentioned in the corresponding task. For a more comprehensive study of results,
